Here is the rewritten chapter:

CHAPTER I: THE CANOE BUILDER

Dick stood on the coral ledge, his eyes fixed on the southern horizon. Behind him, the breakers of the outer sea roared and spindrift scattered on the wind. Before him, the lagoon of Karolin stretched out like a tranquil lake, infinite and blue, with fishing gulls flying overhead. This was his domain, his people, his canoes, and his empty houses where the war canoes had once rested on their rollers.

As he gazed out at the lagoon, his brow furrowed, and he turned his back to the calm waters, facing the breakers on the outer beach and the northern sea. Beyond the sea line, invisible, lay Palm Tree, an island as beautiful as a dream, yet swarming with devils.

Little Tari, the son of Le Taioi the net maker, sat on the coral nearby, watching Dick with wide eyes. Tari knew that the men of Karolin had been swept away by war, leaving the women and children defenseless and without a leader. Then, yesterday, this stranger had arrived in a strange boat, with Katafa, the girl who had been blown to sea years ago. The women said he was sent by the gods to be their chief and ruler.

The child's eyes sparkled with curiosity as he asked, "Taori, who are you?"

Dick's gaze dropped to the child, and he smiled. "I am Taori, Tari tatu. Why do you ask?"

Tari's mind was already flitting to other things, attracted by the cries of children hauling in a net. "I do not know... Ai, the fish!" He trotted away, leaving Dick to his thoughts.

As Dick turned back to the north, the memory of the men who had taken possession of Palm Tree stained the beauty of sea and sky. He knew they would build canoes and come to Karolin, drawn by the lagoon's mirror-like reflection in the sky. He could think forward, imagine the danger that lurked beyond the horizon.

A hand fell on his shoulder, and he turned to face Katafa, her dark hair blowing back in the breeze like an eagle's feather. Her eyes, luminous and dark, were fixed on the point where he had been gazing â€“ the due-north sea line.

"Look!" she breathed.

At intervals, Palm Tree became visible from Karolin through the mirage. They had seen it the evening before, and now it was rising again, a mysterious stain in the southern sky, deepening and hardening into a vivid, diaphanous shape.

With Katafa's hand on his shoulder, they stood in silence, their minds untutored, knowing nothing of mirage. They saw again the horde of savages on the beach, monstrous figures in a nightmare, and felt the wind that had filled the sail as they escaped to safety.

As Dick gazed on the loveliness of Palm Tree, his nostrils flared, and his eyes grew dark with hate. They had threatened him, and they had threatened Katafa. They still threatened her. Some day they would come, drawn by the lagoon's light in the sky.

Katafa pointed across the lagoon water to a canoe approaching from the southern beach. It was the canoe he had sent for the canoe builders, and they came down to the white sand of the inner beach to meet it.
