CHAPTER III: THE LITTLE SHIPS

The Pacific's primitive canoes, unstable without their outriggers, dared the sea on a condition: the sea accepted the apology, and the islands were connected. A long-forgotten innovator had crafted the outrigger, changing the course of history. 

As Dick steered the canoe towards the northern beach, he spotted Katafa waiting for him, her dracæna leaf girdle fluttering in the wind, her hand shielding her eyes from the sun. Nearby, children played, and a fishing canoe set out, but Dick's gaze was fixed on Katafa. 

"Katafa," Aioma whispered, crouched by the after outrigger pole, "they said she was dead, her ghost returned with you, Taori, but the dead do not return." 

Dick corrected him, "She wasn't drowned. The wind blew her to Marua, where I was, with Kearney, who built canoes unlike these. Then the god Nan came, followed by the men of Karolin, who fought and were killed. The bad men came, and we fled in the night..." He pointed to the dinghy hauled up on the beach. 

Katafa's voice hailed them from the shore, sweet and clear as a bell. As Dick sprang out, he seized her in his arms, heedless of onlookers. Aioma, meanwhile, made a beeline for the dinghy, running like a boy, his hands exploring every inch of the planking. 

The canoe-builder's eyes were fixed on the unfamiliar craft, his mind working out the secrets of its construction. He had seen the charred remains of Spanish boats on the southern beach, but this was different – a perfect specimen of eastern boat-building. 

As Aioma brooded over the dinghy, Dick and Katafa were lost in their reunion. But when Dick joined Aioma, he found the old man laughing, his criticism of the dinghy growing louder and more derisive. 

Dick winced, feeling a pang of defensiveness for the white man who had built the boat. He grabbed one of the little model ships he had salvaged from Palm Tree – a schooner – and ran to a nearby pool, calling Aioma to come and see what the maker of the dinghy had also created. 

The pool, thirty feet long and twenty feet broad, was clear as crystal, its coral floor rippled by the breeze. Dick launched the schooner, and Aioma watched, mesmerized, as it sailed on an even keel. Then, with a gentle breeze, it glided down the pool, Katafa running to receive it. 

Aioma was intrigued, and soon, he and Dick were on their knees, playing like children, the little schooner sailing from port to port, bowing to the ripples of the pool as the lost Raratonga had once bowed to the Pacific's swell.
