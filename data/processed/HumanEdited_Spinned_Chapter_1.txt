CHAPTER I: THE CANOE BUILDER

Dick stood on the coral ledge, his eyes fixed on the endless expanse of the southern sea. Behind him, the breakers of the outer sea thundered and spindrift scattered on the wind, while before him stretched the calm, blue lagoon of Karolin, a sea within a sea, bounded by its forty-mile ring of coral. The fishing gulls wheeled overhead, and the tribe bustled along the beach, busy with their nets, games, and paraka patches. All of this was his, Dick's, the man who had landed here just yesterday.

But as his gaze shifted from the lagoon to the empty canoe houses, his brow contracted, and he turned his back to the lagoon, facing the breakers on the outer beach and the northern sea. Out there, beyond the sea line, lay Palm Tree, an island beautiful as a dream, yet swarming with devils.

Little Tari, the son of Le Taioi the net maker, sat on the coral nearby, watching Dick with wide eyes. Tari knew that the men of Karolin had been swept away by war, leaving the women and children defenseless and without a leader. But yesterday, a strange new figure had arrived from the northern sea, with Katafa, the girl who had been blown out to sea years ago. The women said he was sent by the gods to be their chief and ruler.

The child's simple curiosity got the better of him, and he asked, "Taori, who are you?" Dick's gaze faltered, and for a moment, he was lost in the haze of his past. He couldn't tell Tari the truth â€“ that he was Dick Lestrange, a boy from beyond the world of Karolin, raised by an old sailor named Kearney on Palm Tree. He couldn't explain how Katafa had come to live with them, or how they had escaped the bad men who had taken over the island. All of that was shrouded in a mist of forgotten memories, consumed by the blaze of tropical light.

Instead, Dick smiled down at Tari. "I am Taori, Tari tatu. Why do you ask?" The child shrugged, already distracted by the cries of the other children hauling in a net. He trotted away, leaving Dick to his thoughts.

As Dick gazed northward, the memory of the men they had escaped from stained the beauty of the sea and sky. The men of Palm Tree had no canoes, but they would build them, and they would come. It might take a long time, but they would come, drawn by the mirror-like blaze of Karolin lagoon in the sky.

Dick's mind was a mix of savage and civilized, able to think forward, around a subject, and imagine. That's why he had sent a canoe to fetch Aioma, Palia, and Tafata, three old men expert in canoe-building. He had seen the danger lurking beyond the horizon, and he would prepare to face it.

A hand fell on his shoulder, and he turned to face Katafa, her dark hair blown back by the breeze, her eyes fixed on the northern sea line. "Look!" she whispered. In the distance, Palm Tree began to materialize, a mysterious stain on the horizon that deepened and hardened until the island stood vivid and beautiful, a dreamlike apparition.

With Katafa's hand on his shoulder, they stood in silence, their untutored minds unaware of the mirage, their eyes fixed on the place they had escaped from. They relived the horror of the Melanesians, the wind in the sail, the yells of the rum-maddened men, and the burning of the schooner. And there, before them, lay the scene of the tragedy, a lovely picture that hid the demons that still inhabited it.

As Dick gazed on the loveliness that was also a threat, his nostrils flared, and his eyes darkened with hate. They had threatened him, but more importantly, they had threatened Katafa. And they still threatened her.

Some day, they would come. The vision of Palm Tree seemed to repeat what instinct told him. They would build canoes and come, drawn by the lagoon's mirror-like light in the sky. They had no women, and here were women, ripe for the taking. Ah, if he had known, danger lay not only to the north but wherever greed, desire, or hatred roamed on that azure sea.

As the vision of Palm Tree faded, Katafa pointed across the lagoon to a canoe approaching from the southern beach. It was the canoe Dick had sent for the canoe builders, and together, they came down to the white sand of the inner beach to meet it.
